Install VirtualBox on OS X
---------
VirtualBox can be easilly installed through https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads with several platforms supported.
I choose Mac OS X 10.8.3 for testing in this case.

Prepare for Cuckoo Sandbox
----------
In order to install Cuckoo, some preparations are needed according to Cuckoo Sandbox Documents. 

First, Installing Python libraries, you may find details at http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/installation/host/requirements.html
as well as http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/installation/host/installation.html.

Second, we may configure the Cuckoo Sandbox by specifing [machine_manager] which is vitualbox in this case, IP & port, and datebase.
Then <machinemanager>.conf is also important. You may see details here http://docs.cuckoosandbox.org/en/latest/installation/host/configuration.html.

In addition, you can also fill your Virustotal API key in processing.conf, if needed.
