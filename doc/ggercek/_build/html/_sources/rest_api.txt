Ovizart system is built on top of this REST API. Main reason of this design approach is providing equality while
minimizing maintenance/porting efforts. Our current interfaces use OvizartProxy to communicate with this REST API.
As webserver Python's BaseHttpServer extended and following features added.

* HTTPS support
* Cookie/Session management
* Easy to extend REST API decorator system
* File operations such as, Upload/Download

Here is the list of REST API features currently supported.
