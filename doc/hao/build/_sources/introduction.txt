OVIZART - NG = Open VÄ°Zual Analsis foR network Traffic

This project aims aimed to analyze the traffic data in a more human readable way. 
It will analyze the information at the application level and displays the assembled information. 


My (Hao Ma) tasks this summer:

* external analyzers
* the reporters
* the CLI + interactive shell.

#. The external analyzers include VirusTotal, Cuckoo Sandbox, and Jsunpack-n.
   I implemented the wrappers for them which is able to integrate with ovizart-ng system.
   I will illustrate them seperately.

#. The reporters are html reporter and pdf reporter. They can convert the analysis results into html and pdf files which are more
   human-readable.

#. The CLI is the first user interface of ovizart-ng, users may submit the tasks to ovizart-ng and wait for response 
   displayed on the CLI screen. I developed the initial version of CLI and then it was modified by Gurcan.

   After CLI, I implemented the interactive shell as well. It is an interactive version of CLI.


Later, I would like to show the *installation guide* for the external analyzers, reporters, as well as the shell.
