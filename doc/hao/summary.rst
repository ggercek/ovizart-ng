Summary

A busy summer is about to end here. I've enjoyed everything about the GSoC especially coding 
as well as discussing with my teammate and mentors.

Through this summer, A new generation of ovizart was built with awesome functionality.

Furture Work
********************

In the following days after the end of GSoC2013, I will keep developing the ovizart-ng and stay with the Honeynet Project closely.
Improve the current analyzers by testing and fixing on bugs. Also, add with more analyzers (like DNS analyzers and more external tools that may help users understand the network).
